# Twitter API Todo

## Objective

Get more familiar with using APIs, in this case the Twitter API, in Ruby.

## Introduction

Scraping sites is one way to get data but many times, companies will expose more data through their application programming interfaces, or APIs. For this todo, we're going to focus on the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1).

## Instructions
* This is a test-driven lab so just get those specs to pass! Before you begin, you need to create an application on your Twitter account at [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/).
* Once you have created your application, you need to create an `application.yml` file in your root directory, and then add the keys to that file. The keys should be named as follows: `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`. In order to make the access tokens, you need to navigate to the `API Keys` section of your application page, and then generate new access tokens from there.
* If you're unsure how to format your keys in the YAML file, see the following [resource](http://docs.ansible.com/YAMLSyntax.html).
* If you get stuck, refer to the [docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1).
